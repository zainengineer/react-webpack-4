* Forked https://github.com/didierfranc/react-webpack-4
* Then added code from https://github.com/didierfranc/redux-react-starter
* ~~New code was not linked with `App.jsx`, snippets are just floating around, so it can be used as structure for cloned projects~~
* The new version uses githooks and its reducer instead of redux reducer. so probably for now I will go with older version
